# Logical-Data-Warehousing-by-Data-Virtualization
In this project, I have take different data from different data sources (Eg: PostgreSQL, Excel, Amazon S3, etc.) and then to integrate them through Data Virtualization tool i.e. Denodo to make a Data Warehouse. It is a simple three- step process to deliver a holistic view of the enterprise:
(1)	Connect to above mentioned data sources,
(2)	Combine the data from the connected data source to form a self - service logical data warehouse.
(3)	Consume the data through a RESTful API provided by Denodo Itself.
